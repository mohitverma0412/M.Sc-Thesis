# Does coupling information give insight to how E/I balance is maintained?

## Abstract 
 
 
## Introduction

Elucidating the prefrontal cortical microcircuit has been challenging, given its role in multiple complex behaviors, including working memory, cognitive flexibility, attention, social interaction and emotional regulation. Additionally, previous methodological limitations made it difficult to parse out the contribution of certain neuronal subpopulations in refining cortical representations. However, growing evidence supports a fundamental role of fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) GABAergic interneurons in regulating pyramidal neuron activity to drive appropriate behavioral responses. Further, their function is heavily diminished in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in numerous psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia and autism. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of the optimal balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I) in cortical circuits in maintaining the efficiency of cortical information processing. Although we are still unraveling the mechanisms of information representation in the PFC, the E/I balance seems to be crucial, as pharmacological, chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches for disrupting E/I balance induce impairments in a range of PFC-dependent behaviors. To address these questions, here we analyze the continuity and form of population plasticity in the PFC of rats learning rules on a Y-maze.

### Data Description
Four Long–Evans male rats with implanted tetrodes in prelimbic cortex were trained on a Y-maze task (see Fig. 1A). Each recording session consisted of a 20 –30 min sleep or rest epoch (pretraining epoch), in which the rat remained undisturbed in a padded flowerpot placed on the central platform of the maze, followed by a training epoch, in which the rat performed for 20 – 40 min, and then by a second 20 –30 min sleep or rest epoch (post-training epoch). Figure 1B shows the structure of these three epochs in the 10 identified learning sessions. Every trial in the training epoch started when the rat left the beginning of the departure arm and finished when the rat reached the end of one of the choice arms. Correct choice was rewarded with drops of flavored milk. Each rat had to learn the current rule by trial-and-error: go to the right arm, go to the cued arm, go to the left arm, or go to the uncued arm. To maintain consistent context across all sessions, the extra-maze light cues were lit in a pseudo-random sequence across trials, whether they were relevant to the rule or not.
The data analyzed here were from a total set of 50 experimental ses- sions taken from the study of Peyrache et al. (2009), representing training sessions starting from naive until either the final training session, or until choice became habitual across multiple consecutive sessions (consistent selection of one arm that was not the correct arm). The 4 rats, respec- tively, had 13, 13, 10, and 14 sessions. From these, we have used here 10 learning sessions and up to 17 “stable” sessions (see below). Tetrode recordings were spike-sorted only within each recording ses- sion for conservative identification of stable single units. In the sessions we analyze here, the populations ranged in size from 15 to 55 units. Spikes were recorded with a resolution of 0.1 ms. For full details on training, spike-sorting, sleep identification, and histology see Peyrache et al. (2009).

### Data analysis. 
We primarily analyze here data from the 10 learning sessions in which the previously defined learning criteria (Peyrache et al., 2009) were met: the first trial of a block of at least three consecutively rewarded trials after which the performance until the end of the session was 􏰀80%. In later sessions, the rats reached the criterion for changing the rule: 10 consecutive correct trials or one error in 12 trials. By these criteria, each rat learned at least two rules.
We also sought sessions in which the rats made stable choices of strat- egy. For each session, we computed P(rule) as the proportion of trials in which the rat’s choice of arm corresponded to each of the three rules (left, right, cued-arm). Whereas P(left) and P(right) are mutually exclusive, P(cued-arm) is not, and has an expected value of 0.5 when it is not being explicitly chosen because of the random switching of the light cue. A session was deemed to be “stable” if P(rule) was greater than some thresh- old 􏰍 for one of the rules, and the session contained at least 10 trials (this removed only two sessions from consideration). Here we tested both 􏰍 􏰁 0.9 and 􏰍 􏰁 0.85, giving 13 and 17 sessions, respectively. These also, respectively, included 2 and 4 of the rule-change sessions. For the time- series in Figure 1C, E, F, we estimated P(rule) in windows of 7 trials, starting from the first trial, and sliding by one trial.
